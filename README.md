24 May 2020: first stable version 1.0 (VCL)
- The component **TSVGIconImageList** with advanced component editor.
- The component **TSVGIconImage** to show SVG into a TImage.
- Demo to show how it works.
- Very high performance for building hundreds of icons.

Those components uses library SVG Martin Walter (Original version (c) 2005, 2008) with license:

This library is included in this project into svg folder

**TSVGIconImageList** and **TSVGIconImage** are similar to **TSVGImageList** and **TSVGImage** included into project: [https://github.com/ekot1/DelphiSVG.git](https://github.com/ekot1/DelphiSVG.git)
but those versions are more efficient in performances, and adds some features like SVGText property, store icons in binary or SVGText format into dfm and more...
