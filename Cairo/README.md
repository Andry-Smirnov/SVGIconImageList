Windows Binaries are from: [DJMaster](https://www.djmaster.com)

* [LibRsvg - 2.40.20 (2017-12-26)](http://www.djmaster.com/freepascal/bindings/librsvg.php)  
  Win32: librsvg-win32.zip

DJMaster also provides fpc bindings but we decided to use the older bindings by Henri Gourvest, which didn't require any adjustments.
